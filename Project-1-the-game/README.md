# Project 1<br>Browser-based Game

## Overview

Your first SEI project will start out with something fun - **a game!**

Thanks to the amount of logic there is in a game, there's no better app than a game to teach you how to **think like a programmer**!

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**.  You got your feet wet with our game code-alongs during class - now it's time to pick a game and go for it.

**You will be working individually for this project**. However, your instructors and instructor assistants will be available for support via the support channel in Slack.  Please be sure to provide the details of the issue you are having - screenshots and relevant code are very helpful.

As a reminder, GA has a zero plagiarism policy - your project's code **must be substantially yours**. **Do not copy code from similar projects, tutorials, or other sources**.  However, using  lines of code from  StackOverflow to accomplish general techniques/algorithms is okay - an example would be using StackOverflow as a source for code that replaces a character at a certain position in a string.

## Planning & Presentation Requirements

### Planning - Due (End of Class) Jan 6th:

- You will share:

	☐ Your choice of game with the github template completely filled out.

	☐ A wireframe of your "main" game screen.

	☐ User stories, aka 'As A User(AAU)'.

### Presentation - (Beginning of Class) Jan 20th:

You will have a maximum of 10 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:


1. **Introduce the Project:**

	☐ Intro your game by paraphrasing the README.
	
2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

	☐ Launch the game by clicking the link in the README.
	
	☐ Play the game! If necessary, manipulate the values of variables in the console to ensure a quick win or loss.
	
3. **Show/discuss your code:**

	☐ Briefly show the HTML & CSS. 
	
	☐ Show the JavaScript and discuss your favorite function.

4. **Share the experience:**

	☐ What was your biggest challenge?
	
	☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?
	
5. **Q & A + Feedback**

## Technical Requirements

### Your App Must:

☐ **Render a game in the browser**.

☐ **Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Use vanilla JavaScript, not jQuery.

☐ Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent.

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.

☐ **Be coded in a consistent** manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. arrow functions.

☐ **Be deployed online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

---

## Necessary Deliverables

☐ The code for **a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages**.

- **A ``README.md`` file** with these sections (**YES** this is **required** and we will be including this as part of your project evaluation!):

  ☐ **\<Your game's title\>**: A description of your game.  Background info of the game is a nice touch.
  
  ☐ **Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual game.
  
  ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...
  
  ☐ **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important. 
  
  ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
  
  > Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted `README.md`. The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ **Frequent commits (at least 1 every day) dating back to the very beginning of the project**. Never delete you repo to "start over".  Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board". **Be sure to create the repo on your personal GitHub account and ensure that it is "public".** Do your best!

    - Include a wide variety of questions with answers.
    - Must lose after a certain amount of time or after X number of bad guesses or once the questions are finished.
1. **Simon**
    - Requires audio and delightful CSS design
1. **Wordle**
    - Requires a large bank of words
1. **Minesweeper**
    - Must implement "flood" feature

    - Make it two player with a computer or a 'player-two' is acceptable. 

**Only the above games are approved. Any deviation must receive approval from your instructor before starting your planning (wireframes & user stories)!**

> IMPORTANT:  Because it's important to demonstrate your ability to perform DOM manipulation using JavaScript, all games should be DOM-based, not canvas-based.

## Attendance

We will be holding stand-up meetings with instructors at **6:30PM PST (Tuesday/Wednesday) and 10:00AM PST / 2:00PM PST (Saturday)** to have a daily check on the progress your application.

There are no full class days during project weeks, but we expect you to be working on your project from at least **6:30PM - 10:45PM PST (Tues/Wed)** and at least **10AM - 6PM PST (Sat)** during class days and be available during that time for any meetings with instructors as needed. You are STILL required to show up to Outcomes during project weeks.   

Instructors will divide the class (if applicable) into breakout rooms for standup. We will also be the people to reach out to for assistance most of the time as well as report to during project week. Think of us as your managers for a client who commissioned a game from the company we work for. We all want to see you succeed and your project, so let's work together! Don't forget it's ok to fall and learn. Come to us for anything. We are here as a valuable resource for you to use. Don't forget to post in debugging, too! It raises the chances of someone seeing it and potentially getting back to you quicker with assistance. 

We also will **still have some attendance checks** during project week, as follows:

  - **Daily (Each Class Day)**: Your attendance will be taken. Official stand-up meetings will start next week. 
  - **Saturday, January 20th**: Project presentation day! You're required to be in the class zoom starting at 10:00 AM PST

_Failure to make an attendance check will result in an **unexcused absence** for that missed time slot_. Standups exist in the workplace and your boss/team need you to be there on time. Let's practice that professional behavior!

## Project Proposal

Create an issue in this repo using the [**Project Proposal** issue template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIRPT-Pomona/Project-1-the-game/issues/new?assignees=bheidelberg%2Cnicolehamilton%2CMarkRRyan&labels=pending+review&template=proposal.md&title=Your+Name) and submit it before the proposal submission deadline **Saturday by 6PM PST**, start of class.  Make sure you complete **all of the prompts**.  Use the example proposal found [here](project_proposal_example.md) as a guide.

Your proposal will be reviewed by the instructor team who will communicate feedback with you directly.


## Project Submission

Create an issue in this repo using the [**Project Submission** issue template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIRPT-Pomona/Project-1-the-game/issues/new?assignees=bheidelberg%2Cnicolehamilton%2CMarkRRyan&labels=&template=project_submission.md&title=Your+Name) and submit it before the presentation deadline **Saturday, January 20th, by 10AM PST**, start of class. Make sure you complete **all of the prompts**. You will need to give us the link to your PERSONAL Github project repo as well as the deployed Github Pages link. 

Attendance and submitting the project submission issue ticket will be required in order to present during class and be counted as present for the day.

### Suggestions

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!

* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, element inspector, etc) to debug and solve problems. Your instructor will have you console.log() things if you have not tried that approach.

* During the day, work through problems in class & **ask questions when you need to!** We're here to help prevent you from burning through your time with wild goose chases, or help you gain insight into how to pivot if you're trying to do too much (this is common with new developers), or make sure you're on track to reach your goals.  But _come to us_!! You need to own your educational journey.

* **Commit early, commit often.**  Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. There should be _at least_ a few dozen commits.

* **Consult documentation** (MDN, CSS libraries, etc.) to better understand the tools you're using.

* **Plan to write code that you know you will remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. Write 26 lines of code that help you solve a problem, even if you only come out of it with 2 useful lines of code that solve your problem precisely.  Even though it might feel weird to delete code you worked hard on for an hour, if it helped you get a solution to a problem, it was time well spent.

- **Theme your game** to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!

- **Keep it simple.** Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great is better than extra functionality added to a game without polish.

- Review and check regularly the **requirements** portion of this README to ensure that your project is going to meet the minimum requirements.

- Write **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.

---

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your projects within the week and feedback will be emailed to the email you used to sign up with GA.
- If your instructors determine that your project does not meet the above requirements (denoted using checkboxes), you may request to address the deficiencies identified. However, be aware that **there is only a single opportunity to resubmit a project or project assessment during the entire course**.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide additional feedback, please ask!
