- Original Game Idea - FATHOM - A Turn Based Strategy Game Played on A Grid 

## Project Description

My game is called FATHOM. It's a board with 18 squares occupied by you and a CPU player, a monster! You and the monster will take turns moving around the board. Normally, you won't know where the monster is until its upon you! However, by using some well-placed spilled paint cans, you might get a chance to see the monsters tracks. 
As one of the last sailors aboard a doomed submarine, you must get from one square to another to complete tasks all while utilizing traps, decoys and weapons to survive along the way. Complete all the tasks, weaken the monster, escape the sub and you win! But, run into the monster too many times and you'll lose all of your health and be stuck in the abyss forever! Good luck!

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals


- As a player, I want to able to complete all the tasks of the game and win.
- As a player, I want to also be able to get caught by the monster enough times and lose.
- As a player, I want informed decisions to make a difference between winning and losing opposed to random chance.
- As a player, I want to have at least 2 useful and functional pieces of equipment I can use to help me win the game.
- As a player, I want the game to feel balanced. Whether the outcome is winning or losing, the result should feel mostly deserved with maybe a small aspect of luck.
- I want the game to have 100% dependable quality of life features such as displays for tracking health and equipment, a game reset button, a drop down menu for rules, drop down menus to explain the role of each room and finally- a drop down menu / self-updating textbox to show past/current/future objectives.
- As a player, I want the game to nearly impossible to "break" even when a player is going out of their to do so.



#### Stretch Goals

- I want the game to feel so balanced, there is truly room for a player's skill to grow upon repeat play sessions.
- I want the game to be challenging and I want that difficulty to come from the monster's abilities to either move around an area randomly but quickly or less quickly but with some form of hunting/tracking of the player's character.
- I want every room to have a clear and logical purpose.
- I want to impliment every piece of equipment I've listed in my google doc and I want each piece to be tested and tweaked to the point of feeling both well-inegrated and well-balanced.
- I want my UI to look good and appropriate for the style of the game.
- Not a single bug/immersion breaking issue.
- MUSIC! I'd love to either find or write some of my own creepy industrial sounding music for this game.
